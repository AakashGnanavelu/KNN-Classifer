# KNN-Classifer

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. It works by finding the k nearest neighbors to a new data point and classifying it based on the majority class of those neighbors.

Imagine you have a dataset of flowers with different features such as petal length, petal width, and sepal length, and you want to classify a new flower based on its features. KNN classifier can help you to find the k nearest neighbors to the new flower and classify it based on the majority class of those neighbors.

In KNN classifier, the value of k is chosen by the user and represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider. Once k is chosen, the algorithm calculates the distance between the new data point and each data point in the dataset. The k nearest neighbors are then selected based on the shortest distance to the new data point.

Once the k nearest neighbors are selected, the algorithm assigns the new data point to the class that occurs most frequently among the neighbors. For example, if the majority of the k nearest neighbors are labeled as "setosa" flowers, the new data point will be classified as a "setosa" flower as well.

KNN classifier is a simple and effective algorithm for classification problems, especially when the dataset is small or the decision boundary is complex. However, it can be sensitive to the value of k and the distance metric used to calculate the distance between data points. Overall, KNN classifier is a useful tool for classifying data points based on the characteristics of their nearest neighbors.
